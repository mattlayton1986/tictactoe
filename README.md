# tictactoe

As part of the #100daysofcode initiative, I'm attempting to build a front-end tic-tac-toe game using only HTML, CSS,and Javascript. This is the fruit of that attempt. 

My code is still pretty basic and unrefined. I welcome all suggestions for improvements, cleaner code, bug fixes, etc. Don't hesitate to email me with tips for improvement.
